By the end of his career, Thomas A. Edison had amassed a total of [1,093 U.S. patents](https://archive.org/details/edison-patent). Most of his patents related to the following industries: 1) electric light and power, 2) sound recordings, 3) telegraphs and telephones, 4) batteries, 5) oil mining and milling, and 6) Portland cement. They also included improvements for motion picture technology, office macinery, chemical production, and miscellaneous other subjects. 

Edison was one of a small group who earned a living as a professional inventor, though many inventors succeeded to some extent by patenting useful inventions in existing industries. This is how Edison's career began. He focused on improving the telegraph apparatus he used as a telegraph operator and forged connections with key figures in the industry, first in Boston, then in New York, who provided him with the funding he needed to develop and patent his ideas. 

The patent process required time, money, knowledge, and often being in the right location. As tools and materials were necessary to create prototypes/models, for those that did not have these resources, workplaces often doubled as inventive spaces. These spaces provided access and training to poor or isolated inventors. The geographical location of these workplaces also had an impact on the success of an inventor. While Edison was conveniently located near the inventive hub of New York City, which saw a rising trend of inventive activity, funding, and legal representation for patent-seekers, inventors in more rural or Southern areas would have had a harder time accessing information and resources.

Although the American patent system was more democratic and less expensive than those in Europe, inventors with limited resources still found it difficult to afford the necessary expenses and would sometimes be put off applying for a patent because of a lack of funds. Although the filing fees were quite modest in the American patent system, especially in comparison to those in Europe, successful applications sually required the services of a patent attorney to write the proper specification and a draftsman to produce required standardized drawings. One the application was allowed, the inventor had to pay additional fees before the patent would be issued. Further costs would be incurred if the patent was put in interference with a competing application or an issued patent. Even relatively successful inventors might sometimes lack ready cash to pay fees and sometimes allowed several months to elapse before applying for or having a patent issued, including Edison. 

Barred by social, political, or economic obstacles, White and Black women, and Black men inventors often did not have the same resources or rights to be able to participate in the inventive process to the extent that Edison did. This exhibit explores the experiences, struggles and accomplishments of these marginalized groups within the world of inventing by focusing on a few individual cases. 

## Creating the U.S. Patent system (create a new page)
 
Patent Clause in the Constitution, protecting inventors for their ideas, 

At the turn of the 18th century, not long after America had gained its independence, the first patent act was passed in Congress. Titled “An Act to promote the Progrefs of useful Arts”, the ==Patent Act of 1790=={Q7144460} established legally-protected intellectual property rights in an effort to fuel the economy, and to improve the overall quality of life through innovation.

To receive a patent in the 19th century, inventors had to take an oath, describe the invention, pay a fee, and submit a drawing or model. Once the patent application was approved, the inventor received “the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery” (==Patents Act of 1836=={Q7144462}, ch. 357, 5, Stat. 117, 119). If unauthorized use was made by others, inventors had the right to sue them for infringement, which happened frequently with underrepresented inventors.

Due to the fact that women and enslaved people around this time were not allowed to own property, and because they were often discouraged from going to school or gaining valuable working experience in order to invent. These groups lacked the financial resources, education, and scientific community that White men had utilized for decades.
