# Edison, Gender & Race, an Introduction

This exhibit is a collaboration between ==Edison Papers=={Q107417971} Director Paul Israel, intern NAME from the Rutgers Public History Certificate program, and Erin Mustard, who helped the project develop its digital and public humanities outreach.

By the end of his career, Thomas A. Edison had amassed a total of [1,093 formal patents.](https://archive.org/details/edison-patent).Of these, his most notable inventions were the phonograph, the incandescent light bulb, and the alkaline storage battery. As these gave Edison prominence and support and allowed him to continue his line of work, many other inventors—like White women, Black women, and Black men—were slow to rise to this level of success, if ever. Barred by social, political, or economic obstacles, underrepresented inventors often did not have the same resources or rights to be able to participate in the inventive process to the extent that Edison did. As this exhibit aims to demonstrate, there were a number of exclusive experiences, struggles, and accomplishments by these marginalized groups within the world of inventing that largely set them apart from Edison.

At the turn of the 18th century, not long after America had gained its independence, the first patent act was passed in Congress. Titled “An Act to promote the Progrefs of useful Arts”, the ==Patent Act of 1790=={Q7144460} established legally-protected intellectual property rights in an effort to fuel the economy, and to improve the overall quality of life through innovation.

To receive a patent in the 19th century, inventors had to take an oath, describe the invention, pay a fee, and submit a drawing or model. Once the patent application was approved, the inventor received “the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery” (==Patents Act of 1836=={Q7144462}, ch. 357, 5, Stat. 117, 119). If unauthorized use was made by others, inventors had the right to sue them for infringement, which happened frequently with underrepresented inventors.

The patent process required time, money, knowledge, and often being in the right location. As tools and materials were necessary to create prototypes/models, for those that did not have these resources, workplaces often doubled as inventive spaces. These spaces provided access and training to poor or isolated inventors. The geographical location of these workplaces also had an impact on the success of an inventor. While Edison was conveniently located near the inventive hub of New York City, which saw a rising trend of inventive activity, funding, and legal representation for patent-seekers, inventors in more rural or Southern areas would have had a harder time accessing information and resources.

Due to the fact that women and enslaved people around this time were not allowed to own property, and because they were often discouraged from going to school or gaining valuable working experience in order to invent. These groups lacked the financial resources, education, and scientific community that White men had utilized for decades.

This exhibit will focus on the inventions of Black men, Black women, and white women as they worked within, and against, the structural oppression of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.




Although White women’s property rights advanced at a much faster pace than for those of people of color (regardless of gender), White women still experienced a slow rise to legal protections and equality. Here, the most progressive legislation for women’s property rights in the 20th century came out of [New York’s “Married Women’s Property Act” of 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Acts_in_the_United_States#cite_note-khan-8), nearly 72 years after the Declaration of Independence, which finally allowed for married women to conduct business on their own and own property in what was known as a “separate economy”. The pressure to pass this legislation in New York was led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and many others.

Only three years prior had New York even granted women the ability to own, protect, and earn money from their patents as if they were “unmarried”. However, as has been discussed elsewhere, the Women's Rights Convention, and its leaders, [eventually jetttisoned the concerns and experiences of Black women.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/black-women-and-the-fight-for-voting-rights.htm#:~:text=During%20the%2019th%20and%2020th,gain%20the%20right%20to%20vote.)
