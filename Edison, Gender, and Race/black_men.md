## Introduction
For Black inventors, the racism and structural oppression of their everyday lives extended into the  inventive field, requiring them to carefully navigate the field's political and social aspects; slavery, segregation, and racialized violence affected every aspect of their lives, including the inventive process. As court rulings like ==Plessy V. Ferguson=={Q656660} demonstrated that the government would not recognize the rights of Black Americans, it made it nearly impossible for Black Americans to get around and access much needed segregated patent attorneys, patent libraries, workplaces, and access important information or valuable work experience relating to the process of invention. In the years following the ==Tulsa Race Massacre=={Q1824714}, and in the direct aftermath of the racist laws and leadership that fueled events like it, invention within the Black community became unusually low. 

Fighting uncertainties like personal security, political disenfranchisement, and work discrimination, it becomes clear that this was not an environment that could foster innovation.  The implications of racialized violence in the South stalled Black inventive activity for years. White patents and Black patents followed a similar patenting trend (though at a much lesser rate) for the majority of the late 1800s.[^1]. It has  become apparent that as lynchings and other racialized violence increased, Black invention greatly decreased, which widened the gap between White and Black-patented inventions as well as increased the economic inequality and oppression already present within the patenting system.

## Granville T. Woods (1856-1910)

Born in 1865 to free African Americans, ==Granville T. Woods=={Q3115447} contributed greatly to the telegraph and railroad industries. Known as "Black Edison," Woods  carved out a a career in invention that would dictate the course of his work immensely. In his early teens, Woods worked in a machine shop, and later worked as a locomotive engineer, which ignited his passion for invention and later helped him make leading breakthroughs in railway technology. However, while railroad technology might have been his passion, his financial situation forced him to patent a number of miscellaneous patents in emerging industries to stay solvent. As patenting required upfront fees, like a standard application fee and all other associated legal fees, Woods would often have to borrow money from acquaintances while he waited for his patents to be used. Stuck in this cycle of being unable to make ends meet, Woods travelled to New York, in 1890,and met James S. Zerbe, the manager of the “American Patent Agency.” Zerbe promised to put him on the rise, but instead exploited Woods for his patents, his knowledge, his shares of the profits, and even his most prized electric railway system (close to the one we see on trains today). Woods would eventually take Zerbe to court and win his patents back.[^3] In his lifetime, he would be granted 45 total patents of which the most notable today are the electric railway system, the electric railway conduit, and the telegraphony. Although Woods was disconnected from larger groups of inventors and their social hubs, unable to find paying work, and was exploited, he is now known as a successful Black inventor who patented some of the most important railway inventions.

## Garrett Morgan (1877-1963)

==Garret Morgan=={Q1316686} is most widely known for his invention of the gas mask in 1914, and an early model of the traffic light we use today in 1923. Born to a formerly enslaved person in Kentucky, but later relocated to Ohio, Morgan had very little formal education yet early on he demonstrated a quick knack for invention. Working in and around sewing-machine factories, Morgan’s first patent would be for a refined sewing machine that, through the sale of this patent, would eventually allow him to start his own sewing business. From his business, out of trying to find solutions for common sewing problems that he encountered, In 1909, Morgan accidentally developed a hair straightening cream while trying to find solutions for common sewing problems. In 1911, however, the ==Triangle Shirtwaist fire=={Q867316} would catch Morgan’s attention. After learning of the lack of protective gear and fire equipment, he would begin to manufacture a gas mask. Due to racial tension that peaked around this time, the mask’s sales never took off. In an effort to combat this racism and a boycott of his products, Morgan hired a white actor to advertise the mask and then he disguised himself as a great Native American Chief behind the whole invention. In 1916 the Cleveland waterwork tunnel explosion fueled Morgan into action once again. Workers hit a natural gas pocket and the tunnel collapsed, emitting toxic fumes and dust. Morgan arrived at the scene with his gas mask in an effort to rescue as many people as he could. Accounts of how many people Morgan saved varies, as well as how his actions really affected sales. But Morgan arrived at the scene, quickly put his invention to use, and then, for better or for worse, was identified as the true inventor of the gas mask. In addition to his patent on his gas mask, Morgan also patented a traffic light, which he later sold to General Electric for $40,000. Morgan believed in the necessity of his inventions, and was successful despite racist barriers, leading us to wonder how much more valuable work he could have produced without those barriers.

## Shelby Davidson (1868-1931)

Born in 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, ==Shelby J. Davidson=={Q97141688} stands out from other inventors by his desire to use invention to advance his career rather than only to contribute to an industry. Davidson received more formal education than most Black inventors at the time, as well as possessing a quality personal network. This personal network helped him to secure a job at the Department of Treasury through the help of a personal friend and mentor, Kentucky Congressman [William C.P. Breckenridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Campbell_Preston_Breckinridge#:~:text=William%20Campbell%20Preston%20Breckinridge%20(August,Breckinridge.). While this job quickly granted him a number of promotions, Davidson would eventually reach the office of the Auditor for the Post Office where he would establish himself as the Chief-Clerk of the adding machines of his unit. By the time Davidson joined this division,the adding machines were constantly breaking down, and real auditors had to perform handwritten calculations that were sometimes incorrect, which impacted productivity. Seeing a clear need to improve these machines, Davidson became in charge of all of the repairs and adjustments to the adding machines. By the time he filed his first patent for an adding machine add-on device, Davidson was already a well-established expert in the area. His expertise and ingenuity certainly granted him a number of opportunities, including the ability to work directly with adding machine companies as well as the ability to move up the bureaucratic ladder of federal jobs. 
Davidson was not immune to the racist historical events of the early 20th century. As workplaces including Davidon’s became segregated, and as a new and unimpressed auditor was appointed, Davidson was stripped of his managerial and supervisory position. Having to watch the new auditor strike down his accomplishments in public, even though he built a new adding and auditing system from the ground up, while also being forced to a segregated area of the office, Davidson eventually resigned from his position in 1912. Though he would move on to practice law, own a number of real estate properties, and even be named the president of the General Alumni Association of Howard University, Davidson’s success in the Post Office was cut short and there is no telling how much more successful he would have been had it not been for racist policies and the intolerability of Black integration.
