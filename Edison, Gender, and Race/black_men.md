## Introduction
For Black inventors, the racism and structural oppression of their everyday lives extended into the  inventive field, requiring them to carefully navigate the field's political and social aspects; slavery, segregation, and racialized violence affected every aspect of their lives, including the inventive process. As court rulings like ==Plessy V. Ferguson=={Q656660} demonstrated that the government would not recognize the rights of Black Americans, it made it nearly impossible for Black Americans to get around and access much needed segregated patent attorneys, patent libraries, workplaces, and access important information or valuable work experience relating to the process of invention. In the years following the ==Tulsa Race Massacre=={Q1824714}, and in the direct aftermath of the racist laws and leadership that fueled events like it, invention within the Black community became unusually low. 

Fighting uncertainties like personal security, political disenfranchisement, and work discrimination, it becomes clear that this was not an environment that could foster innovation.  The implications of racialized violence in the South stalled Black inventive activity for years. White patents and Black patents followed a similar patenting trend (though at a much lesser rate) for the majority of the late 1800s.[^1]. It has  become apparent that as lynchings and other racialized violence increased, Black invention greatly decreased, which widened the gap between White and Black-patented inventions as well as increased the economic inequality and oppression already present within the patenting system.
