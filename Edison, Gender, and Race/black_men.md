## Introduction
For Black inventors, the racism and structural oppression of their everyday lives extended into the  inventive field, requiring them to carefully navigate the field's political and social aspects; slavery, segregation, and racialized violence affected every aspect of their lives, including the inventive process. As court rulings like ==Plessy V. Ferguson=={Q656660} demonstrated that the government would not recognize the rights of Black Americans, it made it nearly impossible for Black Americans to get around and access much needed segregated patent attorneys, patent libraries, workplaces, and access important information or valuable work experience relating to the process of invention. In the years following the ==Tulsa Race Massacre=={Q1824714}, and in the direct aftermath of the racist laws and leadership that fueled events like it, invention within the Black community became unusually low. 

Fighting uncertainties like personal security, political disenfranchisement, and work discrimination, it becomes clear that this was not an environment that could foster innovation.  The implications of racialized violence in the South stalled Black inventive activity for years. White patents and Black patents followed a similar patenting trend (though at a much lesser rate) for the majority of the late 1800s.[^1]. It has  become apparent that as lynchings and other racialized violence increased, Black invention greatly decreased, which widened the gap between White and Black-patented inventions as well as increased the economic inequality and oppression already present within the patenting system.

Born in 1865 to free African Americans, ==Granville T. Woods=={Q3115447} contributed greatly to the telegraph and railroad industries. Known as "Black Edison," Woods  carved out a a career in invention that would dictate the course of his work immensely. In his early teens, Woods worked in a machine shop, and later worked as a locomotive engineer, which ignited his passion for invention and later helped him make leading breakthroughs in railway technology. However, while railroad technology might have been his passion, his financial situation forced him to patent a number of miscellaneous patents in emerging industries to stay solvent. As patenting required upfront fees, like a standard application fee and all other associated legal fees, Woods would often have to borrow money from acquaintances while he waited for his patents to be used. Stuck in this cycle of being unable to make ends meet, Woods travelled to New York, in 1890,and met James S. Zerbe, the manager of the “American Patent Agency.” Zerbe promised to put him on the rise, but instead exploited Woods for his patents, his knowledge, his shares of the profits, and even his most prized electric railway system (close to the one we see on trains today). Woods would eventually take Zerbe to court and win his patents back.[^3] In his lifetime, he would be granted 45 total patents of which the most notable today are the electric railway system, the electric railway conduit, and the telegraphony. Although Woods was disconnected from larger groups of inventors and their social hubs, unable to find paying work, and was exploited, he is now known as a successful Black inventor who patented some of the most important railway inventions.
