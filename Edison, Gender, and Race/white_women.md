#White Women Inventors




Although White women’s property rights advanced at a much faster pace than for those of people of color (regardless of gender), White women still experienced a slow rise to legal protections and equality. Here, the most progressive legislation for women’s property rights in the 20th century came out of [New York’s “Married Women’s Property Act” of 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Acts_in_the_United_States#cite_note-khan-8), nearly 72 years after the Declaration of Independence, which finally allowed for married women to conduct business on their own and own property in what was known as a “separate economy”. The pressure to pass this legislation in New York was led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and many others.

Only three years prior had New York even granted women the ability to own, protect, and earn money from their patents as if they were “unmarried”. However, as has been discussed elsewhere, the Women's Rights Convention, and its leaders, [eventually jetttisoned the concerns and experiences of Black women.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/black-women-and-the-fight-for-voting-rights.htm#:~:text=During%20the%2019th%20and%2020th,gain%20the%20right%20to%20vote.)
