Although White women’s property rights advanced at a much faster pace than for those of people of color (regardless of gender), White women still experienced a slow rise to legal protections and equality. Here, the most progressive legislation for women’s property rights in the 20th century came out of [New York’s “Married Women’s Property Act” of 1848]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Acts_in_the_United_States#cite_note-khan-8), nearly 72 years after the Declaration of Independence, which finally allowed for married women to conduct business on their own and own property in what was known as a “separate economy”. The pressure to pass this legislation in New York was led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and many others. 

Only three years prior had New York even granted women the ability to own, protect, and earn money from their patents as if they were “unmarried”. However, as has been discussed elsewhere, the Women's Rights Convention, and its leaders, [eventually jetttisoned the concerns and experiences of Black women.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/black-women-and-the-fight-for-voting-rights.htm#:~:text=During%20the%2019th%20and%2020th,gain%20the%20right%20to%20vote.)

As White women were kept out of workspaces or apprenticeships that could have formally cultivated their innovative abilities, they often worked within the industries and produced inventions in less formal ways. Whether this meant working lower-ranking jobs in textile mills or having family members that directly worked in the manufacturing or inventive industry, women rarely had opportunities to work in spaces solely dedicated to invention. But White women continued to utilize their networks and industry knowledge to patent remarkable inventions, despite the lack of research space or formal education.Between 1865 and 1900 women obtained 5,549 patents, though this may be less than the actual number.
