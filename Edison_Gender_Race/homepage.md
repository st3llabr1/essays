## A Short Introduction on Edison
##### By Paul B. Israel

By the end of his career, Thomas A. Edison had amassed a total of [1,093 U.S. patents](https://archive.org/details/edison-patent). Most of his patents related to the following industries: 1) electric light and power, 2) sound recordings, 3) telegraphs and telephones, 4) batteries, 5) oil mining and milling, and 6) Portland cement.

They also included improvements for motion picture technology, office macinery, chemical production, and miscellaneous other subjects. 

Edison was one of a small group who earned a living as a professional inventor, though many inventors succeeded to some extent by patenting useful inventions in existing industries. This is how Edison's career began. He focused on improving the telegraph apparatus he used as a telegraph operator and forged connections with key figures in the industry, first in Boston, then in New York, who provided him with the funding he needed to develop and patent his ideas. 

The patent process required time, money, knowledge, and often being in the right location. As tools and materials were necessary to create prototypes/models, for those that did not have these resources, workplaces often doubled as inventive spaces. These spaces provided access and training to poor or isolated inventors. The geographical location of these workplaces also had an impact on the success of an inventor. While Edison was conveniently located near the inventive hub of New York City, which saw a rising trend of inventive activity, funding, and legal representation for patent-seekers, inventors in more rural or Southern areas would have had a harder time accessing information and resources.

Although the American patent system was more democratic and less expensive than those in Europe, inventors with limited resources still found it difficult to afford the necessary expenses and would sometimes be put off applying for a patent because of a lack of funds. Although the filing fees were quite modest in the American patent system, especially in comparison to those in Europe, successful applications sually required the services of a patent attorney to write the proper specification and a draftsman to produce required standardized drawings. One the application was allowed, the inventor had to pay additional fees before the patent would be issued. Further costs would be incurred if the patent was put in interference with a competing application or an issued patent. Even relatively successful inventors might sometimes lack ready cash to pay fees and sometimes allowed several months to elapse before applying for or having a patent issued, including Edison. 

The chapter below "Patents and Other Business Interests" is an excerpt from the book *Evidence of Progress among Colored People* by G.F. Richings from 1902, made available by the Hathi Trust. It summarizes some of the patents created Black people in the early 20th century.

Barred by social, political, or economic obstacles, White and Black women, and Black men inventors often did not have the same resources or rights to be able to participate in the inventive process to the extent that Edison did. This exhibit explores the experiences, struggles and accomplishments of these marginalized groups within the world of inventing by focusing on a few individual cases. 

This digital exhibit engages with some of the best scholarly literature that exists on the period of post-Reconstruction, Jim Crow laws and impact of Black inventors.
