## Timeline

## Winter Film Capital of the World
.ve-media wc:Roseland_Hotel_1908.jpg left width=80% caption="Winter Studios of the Kalem Company on the grounds of the Roseland Hotel"

Studios often had to stop production in the winter due to the snowy weather of New York and New Jersey, where most of the early motion picture industry was centralized. Film executives would use the time to vacation in Jacksonville for its ideal weather and proximty to the upper states. The most economic form of transportation between the states was by train at the time, so many of them got to see the city's expansive and beautiful scenery as they traveled. In 1908, [Frank Marion](Q3751863), who was a film executive for the [Kalem Company](Q1722143), began to see the potential Jacksonville had as a filming location. He began working out of the Roseland Hotel and shot his films throughout Jacksonville. More studios began moving down over the winter as they realized Jacksonville's capacity for film as well. Within 10 years of Kalem Company Studio being instated, 30 more film companies followed. The cost of doing business was low and there was little red tape prohibiting anyone from setting up shop. Studios often filmed in public spaces, which made the city a production center as well as a live stage where residents could watch a little movie magic first hand. With the silent film era in full swing, Jacksonville found itself a thriving filming location for several years, giving it the nickname of "Winter Film Capital of the World".

## Film in Jax

As the motion picture industry developed during 1908, so too did Jacksonville's reputation as a popular film production city. [Sigmund Lubin](Q593145) was the proud founder of the [Lubin Manufacturing Company](Q116439) in Philadelphia, which was one of the earliest and most ambitious movie studios in America. Lubin also saw Jacksonville's potential and set up another location there to take advantage of the growing film presence. The company was successful for a few years, however as the popularity of the city rose so did the compitition. The Jacksonville Lubin studio was absorbed into the [Vim Comedy Company](Q3559330). One popular celecbrity who previously worked for Lubin was [Oliver "Babe" Hardy](Q72911). Before Hardy teamed up with Stan Laurel to become half of the [Laurel & Hardy](Q33497) duo, he was often cast into two archetypes. One of them being the "heavy", which was typically a physically imposing villian. The other one being a "wise guy" which was a counter to another archetype the "fall guy". After the Laurel & Hardy duo came together they had a special form of comedy called slapstick, which featured a lot of physical comedy and "Tit-for-Tat" fights. They became legendary, often cited as the inspiration for comedy acts and other forms of media later on. Hardy was just one celebrity that found his start during the short golden film making period of Jacksonville, as it only lasted until the early 1920s.

## Troublesome Business
Despite the firstly welcoming attitude Jacksonville had for the studios, tensions soon grew between the film industry and the local community. Residents started to become frustrated with the constant comotion caused by film crews, who often became ocupational hazards, disrupted the city with their loud sets and sometimes filmed stunts without warning or permits. One [incident] involved a car chase scene where a vehicle was driven into the St. Johns River without anyone being notified that it was a movie stunt. It caused quite a stir in the local community and residents began having second thoughts on the film industry being stationed in Jacksonville. Moral opposition also played a role in the distaste for the studios due to certain groups, primarily religious, believing that having them there negatively effected the city's image. In 1917, [John W. Martin](Q888151) was elected for mayor and stood on a platform that openly opposed the film industry. He began refusing permits for filming, sending a clear message that the city no longer welcomed the motion pitcure industry. Studios found themselves increasingly restricted and antagonized and many chose to leave rather than fight the hostile city policies and views. With the film studios being unwelcomed in the city and the rising favor for film studios to relocate to the west coast, Jacksonville's film history has been largely overlooked.

## Norman Studios
.ve-media wc:RichardENorman.jpg left width=80% caption="Richard E. Norman"

The [Norman Studios](Q7052829) was founded by [Richard E. Norman](Q106698166) in 1924, which was years after the film industry's heyday in Jacksonville. Norman began producing silent films that starred all-Black casts in positive, empowered roles. This approach directly contrasted the film standard of casting Black actors as side characters or stereotypes of the Jim Crow Era. Because it was such a timultuous time, the impact of his work shaped not only societal expectations but also standards for the future film industry. Norman Studios contributed to the city’s cultural identity and carved out a prolific place in cinematic history. He came out with several shorts and eight films, most notably "[The Flying Ace](Q7734570)" and "Black Gold". Norman Studios not only contributed to the city’s cultural identity but also carved out a prolific place in cinematic history. Today, the original location of Norman Studios has been transformed into the Norman Studios Silent Film Museum and remians the only standing studio from Jacksonville's early filmmaking period. Now, the museum is an all volunteer non-profit organization that continuously strives to preserve, present and promote the history of silent movies and race films in Northeast Florida.

# Silent Films

## Ups and Downs

.ve-media gh:JHCDigital/Norman-Studio-Speaker-Series/IMG_3963.JPG right caption="Audience watches *Ups and Downs* silent film at Old St. Andrews"

The first film the audience got to watch was a film produced by Vim Comedy Company featuring Oliver "Babe" Hardy as "Shifty Mike", [Bobby Burns](Q2907933) as "Pokes", [Walter Stull](Q7966222) as "Jabbs", and [Ethel Marie Burton](Q79860139) as "Ethel". Bobby Burns and Walter Stull were a well known comedy duo that made up Pokes & Jabbs. They had 12 comedy shorts and though not as popular as Laurel & Hardy, they were well acclaimed. In *Ups and Downs*  Ethel is Jabbs' beautiful daughter who is accosted by Shifty Mike as he carresses her and kisses her lips. Hearing Ethel scream Jabbs comes to her rescue and manages to chase Shifty away. Pokes is Ethel's true love, though he isn't very wealthy. Shifty sets up a scheme to hire someone to try and obstruct Jabbs so he can get to his daughter. Pokes is the one to take up the offer, unknowingly working for his love's assailant. Pokes is ordered to throw an explosive through the window of the Jabbs residence. Antics ensue and the whole cast minus Ethel plays a game of hot potato with the live explosive that ends back around to Pokes' feet as it detonates. Shifty runs off to capture Ethel with Pokes hot on his tail. Shifty and Pokes get in a physical altercation that ends with Pokes being victorious and successfully rescuing his sweetheart in the end.

## Jolly Tars
.ve-media gh:JHCDigital/Norman-Studio-Speaker-Series/IMG_3971.JPG right caption="Audience watches *Jolly Tars* silent film at Old St. Andrews"

The second film, *Jolly Tars* was produced by [Jaxon Film Corporation](Q18466827)s, starred Pokes and Jabbs as the main duo, and was filmed at Memorial Park, in Riverside. The film focused on two sailors noticing a county fair happening while on their ship. Looking through binoculars they see a few women hornpipe dancing and decide to pursue them. Once off the ship and into the fair they engage in a fair bit of classic gags, laughs, and hijinks. The main physical comedy came from the sailors bursting into the same hornpipe dance every few minutes as they search for the women. They encounter plenty of obstacles that served as props for their light and funny adventure. Eventually, the ending is left ambiguous with a scene of a bear in a cage escaping and the audience can assume they contiue their adventure off screen as the credits roll.

# JHC Exhibit

The Jacksonville History Center highlighted Norman Studios' impact with an exhibit of artifacts included items from Norman Studios past and Jacksonville's film history. On prominent display was an early 1900's film projector with accompanying film reels. There were several references to Norman Studio's most famous productions through the form of photographs and newspaper clippings as well as a promotional poster for "Black Gold". Along with those were three business cards all relating to Norman Studios and Norman Laboratories. Two books that featured Norman Studio as well as prolific film figures were also on display: *Richard E. Norman and Race Filmmaking* by Barbara Tepa Lupack and the second *The First Hollywood: Florida and the Golden Age of Silent Filmmaking* by Shawn C. Bean. Each item was carefully curated by the Jacksonville History Center's Research Archivist, Shawn Stermer. A sensitivity notice was posted as some of the artifacts used outdated language.
